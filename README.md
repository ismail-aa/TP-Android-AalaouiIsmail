# TP-Android-AalaouiIsmail

This project was developed in Android Studio using Android 15 (API level 36)

## Product List And Product Details

There are 5 products (the same as in my previous Angular project). their details are saved locally within the code and the images are located in res/drawable. Once you click on a product,you're moved to the product details page of that product you selected. you can go back to the list using the arrows or the blue button at the bottom

## Display Examples

This is the product list :
